## 📌 Problem Statement


PS 3: Real-Time Stampede Risk Detection


---


## 🎯 Objective


The primary objective of the Stampede Predictor project is to develop and deploy a robust system capable of analyzing crowd dynamics from video feeds (live streams or uploaded files) to identify potential stampede risks. It aims to provide actionable insights and early warnings to stakeholders such as event organizers, security personnel, and public safety agencies. By visually highlighting high-density areas and indicating risk levels, the application empowers users to take timely preventative measures, thereby enhancing safety and potentially saving lives in crowded environments like concerts, festivals, sporting events, and public gatherings. The real-world value lies in transforming reactive crowd management into a proactive safety strategy.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Members:

- Katam Jnana Sumayi 
- C. Sainadha Reddy 
- Y. Shashidhar


### Your Approach:

- **Why you chose this problem:** We were motivated by the critical need for improved safety measures in crowded public spaces. Witnessing incidents in such environments underscored the importance of developing a tool that could proactively identify and alert to potential dangers before they escalate into stampedes. Leveraging AI for this purpose felt like a direct way to contribute to public safety.
- **Key challenges you addressed:** Significant challenges included achieving efficient real-time object detection (specifically, detecting people) in varying conditions, accurately calculating and interpreting crowd density across a defined grid, managing the streaming of video data and analysis results, ensuring the application could handle both live camera feeds and static file uploads, and integrating a messaging queue like Fluvio for decoupled data processing and monitoring. Building a responsive and intuitive user interface that clearly communicates risk levels was also a key focus.
- **Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking:** An initial consideration was using simpler image processing techniques, but brainstorming led us to adopt a deep learning approach with YOLO for more accurate and robust person detection. Integrating Fluvio was a crucial pivot that allowed us to separate the core analysis logic from the web presentation layer, making the system more scalable and enabling external consumption of the crowd data. Developing the Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation for the live feed was a breakthrough that provided seamless, real-time status updates to the user interface without constant polling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack


### Core Technologies Used:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the web interface and live status updates via SSE)
- Backend: Flask (Python framework for the web server, handling requests and running the analysis)
- Database: None (The application focuses on real-time processing and data streaming rather than persistent storage of analysis results, though Fluvio could potentially feed into a database).
- APIs:
    - OpenCV (`cv2`): For video/image capture, processing, drawing overlays, and encoding frames.
    - Ultralytics (`YOLO`): Provides the implementation for the YOLOv11 Nano object detection model.
    - Fluvio: Used as a real-time messaging queue for streaming analysis data.
- Hosting: Local Development Environment (designed for potential deployment on cloud platforms or edge devices).


### Sponsor Technologies Used:

- ✅ **Fluvio:** Fluvio is a mandatory component of this project, used for real-time data streaming. The Flask application (`app.py`) acts as a Fluvio producer, publishing structured data (including frame number, overall status, person count, and the detailed density grid) to the `crowd-data` topic for each processed frame or image. A separate Python script (`predict_stampede.py`) acts as a Fluvio consumer, subscribing to the `crowd-data` topic to receive and process this stream of real-time crowd metrics. This architecture demonstrates a decoupled approach where the analysis results are available for immediate consumption by other services or monitoring tools, enhancing the system's flexibility and scalability.

## 🧪 How to Run the Project


### Requirements:

- Operating System: Linux or macOS (Recommended)
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Fluvio Cluster (Running locally or accessible)
- OpenCV library and its dependencies (usually installed with `opencv-python`)
- YOLO model file (`yolo11n.pt`) - The `ultralytics` library will attempt to download this automatically on the first run if it's not found locally.


### Local Setup:


1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JSumayi/Stampede-Detection.git
    cd Stampede-Detection
    ```

2.  **Set up a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    This isolates project dependencies from your system Python environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command will install `Flask`, `opencv-python`, `ultralytics`, `numpy`, `fluvio`, `werkzeug`, `mimetypes`, and `shutil`.

4.  **Ensure Fluvio Cluster is Running:**
    The application requires a running Fluvio cluster to stream data. If you don't have Fluvio installed, follow the official Fluvio installation guide. Once installed, start a local cluster:

    ```bash
    fluvio cluster start
    ```
    Verify the `crowd-data` topic exists. If not, create it:

    ```bash
    fluvio topic create crowd-data
    ```

5.  **Run the Fluvio Consumer:**
    Open a **new terminal window** separate from where you will run the Flask app. Activate the virtual environment (steps from step 2). Then run the consumer script:

    ```bash
    # On Windows:
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    python predict_stampede.py
    ```
    This script will connect to your Fluvio cluster and subscribe to the `crowd-data` topic. It is configured to start reading from the end of the topic (`Offset.from_end(0)`), meaning it will only display messages produced *after* the consumer starts running. You will see analysis data printed to this terminal as the Flask app processes media.

6.  **Run the Flask Web Application:**
    Open a **third terminal window** (or reuse one if you don't need the consumer output visible simultaneously). Activate the virtual environment (steps from step 2). Then run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    # On Windows:
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    python app.py
    ```
    The application will start the Flask development server, typically hosting on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. It will attempt to load the YOLO model and connect to Fluvio during its startup process. Check the console output for confirmation of successful loading and connection.

7.  **Access the Web Application:**
    Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the application's address:

    * **Main Page (Upload):** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
    * **Live Feed Page:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/live` (You can specify a camera index as a query parameter, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/live?camera=1`, if you have multiple webcams connected).

    Use the web interface to upload media files or start the live webcam analysis. Observe the output in your browser and, if running, the data stream in the `predict_stampede.py` terminal.


#### Optional: Adjusting Density Thresholds

If you need to fine-tune the sensitivity of the crowd density detection, you can adjust the threshold values directly in the `app.py` file:

1.  Open the `app.py` file in a text editor.
2.  Locate the "Density Analysis Settings" section.
3.  Modify the values for the following constants as needed:

    ```python
    HIGH_DENSITY_THRESHOLD = 5
    CRITICAL_DENSITY_THRESHOLD = 8
    HIGH_DENSITY_CELL_COUNT_THRESHOLD = 3
    CRITICAL_DENSITY_CELL_COUNT_THRESHOLD = 2

    DETECTION_THRESHOLD = 0.02125 # Confidence threshold for YOLO detections
    ```

    * `HIGH_DENSITY_THRESHOLD`: The number of persons in a grid cell to be considered high density.
    * `CRITICAL_DENSITY_THRESHOLD`: The number of persons in a grid cell to be considered critical density.
    * `HIGH_DENSITY_CELL_COUNT_THRESHOLD`: The number of high-density cells required to trigger a "High Density Warning" status.
    * `CRITICAL_DENSITY_CELL_COUNT_THRESHOLD`: The number of critical-density cells required to trigger a "CRITICAL RISK" status.

4.  Save the `app.py` file.
5.  Restart the Flask web application (`python app.py`) for the changes to take effect.
